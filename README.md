# C++ Practice Repository

Welcome to my C++ practice repo!  
This repository contains a collection of programs written as part of my journey to master C++ â€” from basic syntax to object-oriented programming and data structures.

## ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here

- ðŸ”¹ **Basic Programs**: Input/output, variables, loops, conditionals, functions
- ðŸ”¹ **Intermediate Concepts**: Arrays, strings, pointers, dynamic memory
- ðŸ”¹ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism
- ðŸ”¹ **STL & Advanced Topics** *(coming soon)*: Vectors, maps, sets, etc.
- ðŸ”¹ **Mini Projects**: Simple real-world programs like calculators and record systems
